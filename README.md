## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- OpenRouter API key → [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Google Chrome (for voice input)

### Local Setup

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coding-smit/jarvis_python_project.git
cd jarvis_python_project
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Set your API key**

Create a `.env` file in the root folder:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
```

Or set it directly in `app.py` for local testing:
```python
api_key=os.environ.get("OPENROUTER_API_KEY", "sk-or-v1-your-key-here")
```

**4. Run the app**
```bash
python app.py
```

**5. Open in Chrome**
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## 🗣️ Voice Commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `Open Google` | Opens google.com |
| `Open YouTube` | Opens youtube.com |
| `Open Facebook` | Opens facebook.com |
| `Open Instagram` | Opens instagram.com |
| `What time is it` | Speaks current time |
| `What is today's date` | Speaks current date |
| `Tell me a joke` | AI responds with a joke |
| `Any question...` | GPT-4o-mini answers in one line |

---

## 🧩 How It Works

```
User speaks or types a command
        ↓
Browser sends POST request to Flask /command
        ↓
Flask checks built-in commands (open, time, date)
        ↓
If no match → sends to GPT-4o-mini via OpenRouter
        ↓
Response returned to browser
        ↓
Browser speaks response using SpeechSynthesis API
```
